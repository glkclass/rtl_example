1. Synthesized Verilog RTL-implemntation: reg_file.v.
Description: 
	Five 8-bit regs, can be read/written via SPI according to spec. Reg # 5 is read only.
	If write/read is requested while previous operation is in the progress - it's ignored and doesn't corrupt active transaction.

2. SystemVerilog TestBench: reg_file_tb.sv.
Description: 
	Write/read data, check functionality (use hash array containing relevant Reg data (stored during write) to check read results).
	If read data doesn't match written one - appropriate error message is printed to stdout.
	Use different scenario of write/read: single write, single read, 
	two consecutive operations(write or read) withot gap between them, write while the previous operation isn't finished, ...
